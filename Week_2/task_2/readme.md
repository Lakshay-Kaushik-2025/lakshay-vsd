# VSDBabySoC

VSDBabySoC is a small SoC including PLL, DAC, and a RISCV-based processor named RVMYTH.



# VSDBabySoC Modeling

Here we are going to model and simulate the VSDBabySoC using `iverilog`, then we will show the results using `gtkwave` tool. Some initial input signals will be fed into `vsdbabysoc` module that make the pll start generating the proper `CLK` for the circuit. The clock signal will make the `rvmyth` to execute instructions in its `imem`. As a result the register `r17` will be filled with some values cycle by cycle. These values are used by dac core to provide the final output signal named `OUT`. So we have 3 main elements (IP cores) and a wrapper as an SoC and of-course there would be also a testbench module out there.


## Step by step modeling walkthrough

In this section we will walk through the whole process of modeling the VSDBabySoC in details. We will increase/decrease the digital output value and feed it to the DAC model so we can watch the changes on the SoC output. Ubuntu(18.04 LTS)

  1. Installing the dependencies in the system:

  ```
  $ sudo apt install make python python3 python3-pip git iverilog gtkwave docker.io
  $ sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
  $ cd ~
  $ pip3 install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas
  ```

  2. Cloning the VSDBabySoC repository:

  ```
  $ cd ~
  $ git clone https://github.com/manili/VSDBabySoC.git
  ```

  3. Synthesis:

  ```
  $ cd VSDBabySoC
  $ make pre_synth_sim
  ```
  
  The result of the simulation (i.e. `pre_synth_sim.vcd`) will be stored in the `output/pre_synth_sim` directory.

  4. Waveform Simulation:

  ```
  $ gtkwave output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.vcd
  ```
  
  Two most important signals are `CLK` and `OUT`. The `CLK` signal is provided by the PLL and the `OUT` is the output of the DAC model. Here is the final result of the modeling process:

In this picture we can see the following signals:

  * **CLK:** This is the `input CLK` signal of the `RVMYTH` core. This signal comes from the PLL, originally.
  * **reset:** This is the `input reset` signal of the `RVMYTH` core. This signal comes from an external source, originally.
  * **OUT:** This is the `output OUT` signal of the `VSDBabySoC` module. This signal comes from the DAC (due to simulation restrictions it behaves like a digital signal which is incorrect), originally.
  * **RV_TO_DAC[9:0]:** This is the 10-bit `output [9:0] OUT` port of the `RVMYTH` core. This port comes from the RVMYTH register #17, originally.
  * **OUT:** This is a `real` datatype wire which can simulate analog values. It is the `output wire real OUT` signal of the `DAC` module. This signal comes from the DAC, originally.

**PLEASE NOTE** that the sythesis process does not support `real` variables, so we must use the simple `wire` datatype for the `\vsdbabysoc.OUT` instead. The `iverilog` simulator always behaves `wire` as a digital signal. As a result we can not see the analog output via `\vsdbabysoc.OUT` port and we need to use `\dac.OUT` (which is a `real` datatype) instead.

# OpenLANE

OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault, SPEF-Extractor and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization. 

## OpenLANE installation

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane.git
  $ cd OpenLane/
  $ make openlane
  $ make pdk
  $ make test
  ```



# Post-synthesis simulation

The design is synthesised by the yosys and we see the post synthesis simulation to ensure that it matches with the pre synthesis RTL Simulation.

## Synthesizing using Yosys

* In OpenLANE the RTL synthesis is performed by `yosys`.
* The technology mapping is performed by `abc`.
* Finally, the timing reports for the synthesized netlist are generated by `OpenSTA`.

## Synthesising the Design

To perform the synthesis process do the following:

  ```
  $ cd ~/VSDBabySoC
  $ make synth
  ```
 When the process has been done, we can see the result in the `output/synth/vsdbabysoc.synth.v` file.

## Post-synthesis simulation (GLS)

  ```
  $ cd ~/VSDBabySoC
  $ make post_synth_sim
  ```
The result of the simulation (i.e. `post_synth_sim.vcd`) will be stored in the `output/post_synth_sim` directory and the waveform could be seen by the following command:

  ```
  $ gtkwave output/post_synth_sim/post_synth_sim.vcd
  ```
Here is the final result:

In this picture we can see the following signals:

  * **\core.CLK:** This is the `input CLK` signal of the `RVMYTH` core. This signal comes from the PLL, originally.
  * **reset:** This is the `input reset` signal of the `RVMYTH` core. This signal comes from an external source, originally.
  * **OUT:** This is the `output OUT` signal of the `VSDBabySoC` module. This signal comes from the DAC (due to simulation restrictions it behaves like a digital signal which is incorrect), originally.
  * **\core.OUT[9:0]:** This is the 10-bit `output [9:0] OUT` port of the `RVMYTH` core. This port comes from the RVMYTH register #17, originally.
  * **OUT:** This is a `real` datatype wire which can simulate analog values. It is the `output wire real OUT` signal of the `DAC` module. This signal comes from the DAC, originally.

The `iverilog` simulator always behaves `wire` as a digital signal. As a result we can not see the analog output via `\vsdbabysoc.OUT` port and we need to use `\dac.OUT` (which is a `real` datatype) instead.
