# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

This repository contains all the work I will be doing in the 10 weeks program offered by **VSD VLSI** starting from September 18 2025.

This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks and assignments inside each week.

## Week 0 — Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | 
|------|-------------|
| **WEEK 0** |  [Tools Installation](Week_0/Week-0.md) | 
| **WEEK 1** |  [Synthesis & GLS](Week_1/) |



###  Key Learnings from Week 0
- Installed and verified **open-source EDA tools** successfully.  
- Learned about **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow experiments**.
