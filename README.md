# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

This repository contains all the work I will be doing in the 10 weeks program offered by **VSD VLSI** starting from September 18 2025.

This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks and assignments inside each week.

## Week 0 — Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | 
|------|-------------|
| **WEEK 0** |  [Tools Installation](Week_0/Week-0.md) | 
| **WEEK 1** |  [Synthesis & GLS](Week_1/) |
| **WEEK 2** |  [SoC Fundamentals and Modelling](Week_2/)
| **WEEK 3** |  [Post Synthesis Simulation and STA Analysis](Week_3/)


###  Key Learnings from Week 0
- Installed and verified **open-source EDA tools** successfully.  
- Learned about **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow experiments**.

###  Key Learnings from Week 1
- Verilog **RTL design** and simulation.  
- Using **Icarus Verilog and GTKWave** for simulation and waveform analysis.  
- Logic synthesis using **Yosys and the SKY130 open-source PDK**.
- Key digital design concepts: testbenches, timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, and **optimization techniques**.

### Key Learnings from Week 2
- Fundamental understanding of **SoC Designing** and Structure.
- RTL simulation of BabySoC using **gtkwave** and **iverilog**.
- Synthesis and Post synthesis simulation of the SoC using "**OpenLane**" toolchain.

### Key Learnings from Week 3
- **Post Synthesis Simulation** Of BabySoC and waveform analysis.
- Installed **OpenSTA** for timing analysis.
- **STA analysis** of the synthesised BabySoC design with help of **Tcl** scripts.
